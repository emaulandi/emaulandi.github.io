Hi ! I'm Edith smiley :smile: nice to meet you !
* On a journey to understand the world through data and information vizualisation. 
* From data research in the wild to dataviz conception and implementation.
* Always surprised how visual stuff go so fast in your brain.
* Love and learn D3.js

From Computer Science to Social Entrepreneurship to travel in Asia, I am obsessed by discovering new things and try to understand them. Best if I can represent them visually so that I can share them with the world.

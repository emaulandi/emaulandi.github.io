Hi ! I'm Edith :wave:  Nice to meet you !

<br>

## **My purpose is to create impact and engage through information design** 
### I am striving to find the best way to represent data to trigger understanding and action

* On a journey to understand the world through data and information vizualisation.  :mag_right:

* From data research in the wild to dataviz conception and implementation.  :computer:

* Always amazed and surprised by how visual stuff go so fast in your brain.  :scream_cat:

* Love and learn D3.js  :bar_chart:

<br>

*From Computer Science to Social Entrepreneurship to travel in Asia, I am obsessed by discovering new things and understand them.*

*Aside from dataviz, I am dedicated to spread boldness and taking action mindeset co-founding [Les Joyeux Audacieux](http://lesjoyeuxaudacieux.strikingly.com/). I also share my yearly challenge going zero waste on [Medium](https://medium.com/@Ed_Patey).*

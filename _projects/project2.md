### Starting from a Viz for social good project ...


 [**Viz for social good**](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/) is a platform for data visualization enthusiasts who aspire to empower mission-driven organizations and increase awareness of social issues through beautiful and informative visualizations. 

| ![Votewomen Logo](http://votewomen.pollicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/votewomenlogotiny.png) | This time, [**Pollicy**](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/join-a-project/pollicy) organisation bring a topic through its initiative **Vote: Women**, which aims to empower women to follow their ambitions of civic leadership and women’s representation.

Through this **Viz for social good** project, the goal of **Vote: Women**  is to create dialogue on women's leadership in Uganda and the overall East Africa region, and from there launch their capacity programs. 

> Pollicy is looking to highlight the potential opportunities that we can do to support more women in leadership positions, and particularly, women leaders focused on women's issues. 

> There is currently little data to show the needs, the challenges, the general overview of issues around promoting women in political positions.

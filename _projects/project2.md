Vote: Women aims to empower women to follow their ambitions of civic leadership and women’s representation.
Pollicy is looking to celebrate the achievement that women have accomplished in the past and highlight the potential opportunities that we can do to support more women in leadership positions, and particularly, women leaders focused on women's issues. There is currently little data to show the needs, the challenges, the general overview of issues around promoting women in political positions.
Through this Viz for social good project, the goal of Vote: Women via the is to create dialogue on women's leadership in Uganda and the overall East Africa region, and from there launch our capacity programs.
